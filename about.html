                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Ashin Zargara was born in April 1955, to a farming family, in a small town located in central <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar" target="_blank">Myanmar</a> (Burma), as a Buddhist novice at the age of ten. He ordained as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Southeast_Asia" target="_blank">Buddhist Monk</a> at the age of twenty. Since then, he practices a strict religious and ascetic lifestyle. (A monk may be a person who decides to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.)</p>
